# budgetTracker

I'm thrilled to unveil my latest project: the Budget Tracker website, Money Mentor! ðŸ’° Managing finances can be challenging, but with the right tools, it becomes a breeze. That's why my teammates Rahul Mondal, Girwan Dhakal, Cyrus Gomes, and I developed this budget tracker, designed to help businesses keep a close eye on their income and expenses, ensuring they stay on top of their financial goals, as part of the final project for our web development class at The University of Alabama. 

This project leverages a robust tech stack, including C# and ASP.NET MVC for the backend, Azure SQL Server for the database, and the OpenAI API for AI integration as a financial teller. One of the standout features is the AI personal financial teller, which provides personalized financial advice and insights to registered users, making financial management not just easier but smarter.

Key features include a user-friendly interface for seamless navigation, secure data handling to ensure your financial data is safe, and the AI financial teller that offers tailored financial advice. I'm incredibly proud of how this project has come together and excited about its potential to help people manage their finances more effectively.
